Can ELB Route Traffic Across Regions?
=====================================

-  No. Shared load balancers cannot distribute traffic across regions.
-  No, but dedicated load balancers can distribute traffic across VPCs. For details about how to add backend servers in a different VPC or an on-premises data center, see :ref:`Configuring Hybrid Load Balancing <elb_ug_hd_0005>`.
