Do Shared Load Balancers Have Specifications?
=============================================

No.

Shared load balancers share underlying resources, and the performance of one load balancer is affected by other load balancers. Only dedicated load balancers have exclusive use of their underlying resources. The performance of a dedicated load balancer is not affected by other dedicated load balancers on the Internet.
