Can I Bind Multiple Certificates to a Listener?
===============================================

You can configure multiple certificates for an HTTPS listener by enabling SNI so that different certificates can be used for authentication based on the domain names of the requests.

For details, see :ref:`SNI Certificate (for HTTPS Listeners) <elb_ug_jt_0021>`.
