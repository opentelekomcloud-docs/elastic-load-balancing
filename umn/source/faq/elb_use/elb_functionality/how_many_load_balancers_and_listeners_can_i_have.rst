How Many Load Balancers and Listeners Can I Have?
=================================================

By default, an account can create up to 50 load balancers, including both shared and dedicated load balancers and 100 listeners. If you need more load balancers or listeners, apply for higher quotas.

All load balancers in your account share the same quota for listeners.
