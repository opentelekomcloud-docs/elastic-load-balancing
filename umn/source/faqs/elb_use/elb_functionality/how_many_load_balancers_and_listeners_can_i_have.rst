How Many Load Balancers and Listeners Can I Have?
=================================================

By default, you can use an account to create a maximum of 50 shared and dedicated load balancers and 100 listeners. If you need more load balancers or listeners, apply to increase the quotas.

All load balancers in your account share the quota of listeners.
