Can I Adjust the Number of Backend Servers When a Load Balancer is Running?
===========================================================================

You can adjust the number of backend servers associated with a load balancer at any time. You can also change the type of backend servers according to your business needs. To ensure service stability, ensure that health checks are normal and that at least one healthy backend server is associated with the load balancer.
