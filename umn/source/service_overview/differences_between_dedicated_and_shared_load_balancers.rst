Differences Between Dedicated and Shared Load Balancers
=======================================================

Each type of load balancer has their advantages.

-  Dedicated load balancers have exclusive use of underlying resources, so that the performance of a dedicated load balancer is not affected by other load balancers. In addition, there are a wide range of specifications available for selection.

-  Shared load balancers share underlying resources so that the performance of a load balancer is affected by other load balancers. Shared load balancers were previously named enhanced load balancers.\ |image1|

   Currently, dedicated load balancers are supported only in the **eu-nl** region.

Advantages of Dedicated Load Balancers
--------------------------------------

-  Robust performance

   Each dedicated load balancer has exclusive use of isolated underlying resources and can provide guaranteed performance. A single dedicated load balancer deployed in one AZ can establish up to 20 million concurrent connections, and a load balancer deployed across two AZs can establish up to 40 million concurrent connections, meeting your requirements for handling a massive number of requests.

-  High availability

   Dedicated load balancers provide a comprehensive health check mechanism to ensure that incoming traffic is routed to only healthy backend servers, improving the availability of your applications.

   Dedicated load balancers on both public and private networks can route traffic across AZs and support automatic DR and service isolation between users.

-  Ultra security

   Dedicated load balancers also allow you to select security policies that fit your security requirements.

-  Multiple protocols

   Dedicated load balancers support the following protocols, including TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTTPS, so that they can route requests from different types of applications.

-  Hybrid load balancing

   Dedicated load balancers can route requests to both servers on the cloud and on premises, allowing you to leverage the public cloud to handle burst traffic.

Feature Comparisons
-------------------

Dedicated load balancers provide more powerful forwarding performance, while shared load balancers are less expensive. You can select the appropriate load balancer based on your application needs. The following tables compare the features supported by the two types of load balancers. (Y indicates that an item is supported, and â•³ indicates that an item is not supported.)
