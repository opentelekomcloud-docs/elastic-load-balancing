Using Shared Load Balancers â€” Advanced Level
============================================

Scenarios
---------

You have two web applications deployed on two ECSs separately, and the web applications provide one domain name but different URLs for users to access.

To forward requests based on URLs, you need to create a load balancer, add an HTTP or HTTPS listener, and add forwarding policies to specify the URLs.

An HTTP listener is used as an example to describe how to route requests from two URLs (**/ELB01** and **/ELB02**) of the same domain name (www.example.com) to different backend servers.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have added security group rules to allow traffic from the ports used by the two ECSs. (Alternatively, you can enable all ports first and then disable the ports that are no longer used.)
-  The security group containing the two ECSs allows traffic from 100.125.0.0/16. (ELB uses these IP addresses to perform health checks and route requests to backend servers.)

Creating ECSs
-------------

ECSs are used as backend servers.

Each ECS needs an EIP to allow you to deploy the backend service on each ECS. In actual use, you can unbind the EIP from each ECS if the ECSs do not need to access the Internet or provide Internet-accessible services after the deployment is complete. Determine whether you need an EIP for your load balancer by referring to `Load Balancing on a Public or Private Network <en-us_elb_01_0004.html>`__.

Deploying the Application
-------------------------

Deploy Nginx on the two ECSs and edit two HTML pages for the web applications so that a page with message "Welcome to ELB test page one!" is returned when ECS01 is accessed, and the other page with message "Welcome to ELB test page two!" is returned when ECS02 is accessed.

#. Log in to the ECSs.

#. Install and start Nginx.

   a. Install Nginx:

      **yum -y install nginx**

   b. Start Nginx:

      **systemctl start nginx.service**

Creating a Load Balancer
------------------------

#. In the upper left corner of the page, click |image6| and select the desired region and project.
#. Hover on |image7| in the upper left corner to display **Service List** and choose **Network** > **Elastic Load Balancing**.
#. Click **Create Elastic Load Balancer** and then configure the parameters.
#. Click **Create Now**.
#. Confirm the configuration and submit your request.
#. View the newly created load balancer in the load balancer list.

Adding a Listener
-----------------

Add a listener to the created load balancer. When you add the listener, create a backend server group, configure a health check, and add the two ECSs to the created backend server group.

| Configure two forwarding policies to forward HTTP requests to the two ECSs, for example, requests from **www.example.com/ELB01/** to ECS01, and those from **www.example.com/ELB02/** to ECS02.\ **Figure 4** Traffic forwarding
| |image8|

#. Hover on |image9| in the upper left corner to display **Service List** and choose **Network** > **Elastic Load Balancing**.
#. Locate the created load balancer and click its name.
#. Under **Listeners**, click **Add Listener**.
#. Configure the listener and click **Next**.

   -  **Name**: Enter a name, for example, **listener-HTTP**.
   -  **Frontend Protocol/Port**: Select a protocol and enter a port for the load balancer to receive requests. For example, set it to **HTTP** and **80**.

#. Create a backend server group, configure a health check, and click **Finish**.

   -  Backend server group

      -  **Name**: Enter a name, for example, **server_group-ELB**.
      -  **Load Balancing Algorithm**: Select an algorithm that the load balancer will use to route requests, for example, **Weighted round robin**.

   -  Health check

      -  **Protocol**: Select a protocol for the load balancer to perform health checks on backend servers. If the load balancer uses TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS to receive requests, the health check protocol can be TCP or HTTP. Here we use HTTP as an example. Note that the protocol cannot be changed after the listener is added.
      -  **Domain Name**: Enter a domain name that will be used for health checks, for example, www.example.com.
      -  **Port**: Enter a port for the load balancer to perform health checks on backend servers, for example, **80**.

Adding Forwarding Policies
--------------------------

#. Click the name of the newly added listener and then click **Add** next to **Forwarding Policies**.
#. Configure the forwarding policy and click **Next**.

   -  **Name**: Enter a name for the forwarding policy, for example, **forwarding_policy-ELB01**.
   -  **Domain Name**: Enter a domain name that will be used to forward the requests, for example, www.example.com. The domain name in the request must exactly match that specified in the forwarding policy.
   -  **URL**: You can also specify a URL to forward the requests, for example, **/ELB01/**.
   -  **URL Matching Rule**: Select the rule for matching specified URL string with the requested URL. Three options are available, **Exact match**, **Prefix match**, and **Regular expression match**. **Exact match** enjoys the highest priority, and **Regular expression match** the lowest priority. Select **Exact match** here.

#. Add the backend server group and configure a health check.

   -  Backend server group

      -  **Name**: Enter a name, for example, **server_group-ELB01**.
      -  **Load Balancing Algorithm**: Select an algorithm that the load balancer will use to route requests, for example, **Weighted round robin**.

   -  Health check

      -  **Protocol**: Select a protocol for the load balancer to perform health checks on backend servers. If the load balancer uses TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS to receive requests, the health check protocol can be TCP or HTTP. Here we use HTTP as an example. Note that the protocol cannot be changed after the listener is added.
      -  **Domain Name**: Enter a domain name that will be used for health checks, for example, **www.example.com**.
      -  **Port**: Enter a port for the load balancer to perform health checks on backend servers, for example, **80**.

#. Select the newly added forwarding policy. On the **Backend Server Groups** tab page on the right, click **Add**.
#. Select the server you want to add, set the backend port, and click **Finish**.

   -  Backend server: ECS01
   -  Backend port: Set it to **80**. Backend servers will use this port to communicate with the load balancer.

#. Repeat `1 <#en-us_elb_02_0001__li1279175813279>`__ to `5 <#en-us_elb_02_0001__li19903154544217>`__ to add another forwarding policy, create a backend server group, and add ECS02 to the backend server group. Configure the parameters.

Verifying Load Balancing
------------------------

After the load balancer is configured, you can access the domain name or the specified URL to check whether the two ECSs are accessible.

#. Modify the **C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts** file on your PC to map the domain name to the load balancer EIP.View the load balancer EIP on the basic information page of the load balancer.\ **Figure 5** **hosts** file on your PC
   |image10|

#. On the CLI of your PC, run the following command to check whether the domain name is mapped to the load balancer EIP:

   **ping www.example.com**

   If data packets are returned, the domain name has been mapped to the load balancer EIP.

#. Use your browser to access **http://www.example.com/ELB01/**. If the following page is displayed, the load balancer has routed the request to ECS01.\ **Figure 6** Accessing ECS01
   |image11|
   |image12|

   **ELB01/** indicates that the default directory named **ECS01** is accessed, while **ELB01** indicates the file name. Therefore, the slash (/) following **ELB01** must be retained.

#. Use your browser to access **http://www.example.com/ELB02/**. If the following page is displayed, the load balancer has routed the request to ECS02.\ **Figure 7** Accessing ECS02
